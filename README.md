Xatkit Core Library
======

A library of common intents that can be reused in multiple bots:
- `Default_Fallback_Intent`: the intent returned from Xatkit when the underlying intent recognition provider doesn't find any intent to match for a given input.
- `Help`: capture typical help messages sent by the user.
