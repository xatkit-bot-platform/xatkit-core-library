## Unreleased

- Improve training sentences for *Help* intent
- Add *Greetings*, *HowAreYou*, and *WhoAreYou* intents. These intents are quite common in designed bot, so we made them easily accessible through the *CoreLibrary*.

## [1.0.1] - 2019-12-01

### Changed
- Generated `xmi` files are now ignored by default. These files are not needed since the Xbase integration (`.intrent` files are loaded and parsed on the fly).

## [1.0.0] - 2019-10-09 

See the release notes [here](https://github.com/xatkit-bot-platform/xatkit-core-library/releases).
